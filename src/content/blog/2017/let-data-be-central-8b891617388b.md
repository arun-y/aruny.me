<p>Data is the new gold. And for organization to get benefit from this data. The data should be accessible to everyone (of course with privecy concern in mind). First of all not all companies have data. And those who have, doesn’t know what to do with data, And those who know what to do with data doesn’t know how to use the data, And those who know how to use the data, sometime doesn’t give access to data to right team in the organization.</p><p>The right way to utlize the data is to make it availalbe to everyone in organization using some central data warehouse. The data should be anonimized and should not have any PII (personally identifiable Information), and if data has got any orgnaizational confidential information, right access permission should be in place). Plus any other thing your security team asks for. I am no security expert by the way.</p><p>The point I am trying to make here is that only when organization makes its data available to various team inside organization the real value can come out of it. If its hidden or controlled in a bureaucratic manner, then organization can loose lot of potential value from those data.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8b891617388b" width="1" height="1" alt="">
